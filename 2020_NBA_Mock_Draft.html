    <h1> 2020 NBA Mock Draft</h1>
    <h4> So, the 2020 NBA Draft is not too far away. It is only a few months away but this years players are way too good to pass on. Let's see what the 2020 NBA Draft could look like!</h4>
       <!-- List of 2020 Draft Picks -->
    <h3> Round 1:</h3>
    <ol>
      <!-- James Wisemen -->
      <li class="NBADRAFT"> Golden State Warriors: James Wisemen, Center, Memphis Unversity </li>

      <h4>He is a terrific player of his size. He is 7 feet tall, 240 pounds with a wingspan of 7 feet and 6 inches. His college career is still in jeopardy after his suspension ruling him out of the games until January. The Warriors are at the bottom of the Western Conference which likely means they will be the ones to end up with the first overall pick. Warriors are suffering after key player depatrures like Kevin Durant and also lost Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to season-ending injuries. Their team can't manage to win games without their key players so this means that they need to stack up on key players in this year's draft such as James Wisemen to help keep their dynasty alive. </h4>
      <li class="NBADRAFT"> New York Knick: Lamelo Ball, Point Guard, Illawara Hawks (NBL)</li>
      <!-- Lamelo Ball -->

      <h4>Lamelo is a big player known for his position. Lamelo Ball is 6 feet 7 inches and weighs about 180 pounds. He is very good at handling the ball and is also known as an elite passer as well. His only weak skill is his defense which he is currently working on improving at in the NBL. The Knicks are at the rock bottom of the Eastern Conference which means that they will end up with the second overall pick in the next year's draft. The Knick haven't been getting along well with each other and even after drafting RJ Barrett and Kevin Knox in the previous NBA Drafts. Lamelo Ball can help the Knicks get going after years of not getting in the NBA Playoffs.</h4>
      <li class="NBADRAFT"> Atlanta Hawks: Anthony Edwards,ac
      <h4>Edwards is a tremendous scorer. He has the talent to become a top-5 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft which is why the Atlanta hawks will draft him. The Atlanta Hawks are the second to last team in the Eastern Conference, just one spot above the New York Knicks. Anthony Edwards stand 6 feet 5 inches, weights 185 pounds, and has a wingspan of 6 feet 9 inches. He has the ability to score from anywhere on the field whether it is a 3 pointer or a post shot. The Atlanta Hawks need someone to help Trae Young form a duo to lead their team into the NBA Playoffs and Edwards just might be the player. </h4>
      <li class="NBADRAFT"> Detroit Pistons: Cole Anthony, Point Guard, University of North Carolina</li>
      <!-- Cole Anthony -->
      <img src="COLE_ANTHONY_UNC.png" alt=cole_anthony height=350 width=500>
      <p>Image created by Fat Squirell Commons CC-BY</p>
      <h4> Cole Anthony is playing at an incredibly pace. He is playing just like a typical NBA player would play. He is very consistent and is really good at scoring and controlling his pace. He shoots when he wants to and if he sees someone open, he would pass it out. He is very strong when it comes to finishing near the rim. He can dunk, layup, and do jelly as well. He is probably a copy of Derrick Rose and since Derrick Rose is also on the Pistons, Cole Anthony can probably learn from him. Cole Anthony has good size as a point guard, standing 6 feet 3 inches tall. He weighs about 185 punds which is the average weight of a point guard and has a wingspan of about 6 feet 4 inches. Cole Anthony can give the Pistons a push and give them consistency of scoring at a pace. </h4>
      <li class="NBADRAFT"> Cleveland Cavaliers: Obi Toppin, Power Forward, Dayton </li>
      <!-- Obi Toppin -->

        <h4> Obi Toppin is becoming to start looking like a pro NBA players. He wasn't supposed to be this high but considering his recent performance, he should he able to be drafted in the top 5 and 10 at least. He is averaging 19.8 points on 37.1 percent shooting from three through 11 games. He is a sharp post scorer and shooter while continuing to give Dayton easy buckets on finishes from high above the rim. He is also a very good leader in terms of helping his team reach in the top AP 25 teams rated out of the whole nation. He is very consistent which NBA teams will tend to look after. He is probably a copy of Anthony Davis except a bit shorter version. Anthony Davis was also a very strong when it came to his post shots but Obi Toppin is a much better shooter when it comnes to shooting from beyond the arc. Obi Toppin can give the Cavaliers a boost and probably can form a trio for alley-opps with Darious Garland and Collin Sexton.</h4>
